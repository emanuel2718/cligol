# TODOLIST:

- [x] add speed button
- [x] change the round reference ---> generation
- [ ] refactor enum classes to camelCase and values to NON-CAPS (avoid conflict with macros)
- [ ] add +1 to speed number so that 1 is the lowest speed
- [ ] make the keybind menu work in the running simulation?
- [ ] if simulation is paused; changing speeds triggers generation update
- [ ] add button info on screen instead of debug coordinates
- [ ] add documentation to README
